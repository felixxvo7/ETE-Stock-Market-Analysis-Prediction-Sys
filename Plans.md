## Technical Analysis

--\> Study price patterns and trends to predict future movements.


### Simple EDA 
  - Compute Indicators : Compute trend, momentum, and volatility indicators. (Moving Average)
  - Correlation Analysis
Correlation helps identify relationships between technical indicators and price movements, or between assets in a portfolio.

```
import pandas_ta as ta

# Add indicators
data.ta.sma(length=20, append=True)       # 20-day Simple Moving Average
data.ta.ema(length=50, append=True)       # 50-day Exponential Moving Average
data.ta.macd(append=True)                 # MACD (12,26,9)
data.ta.rsi(length=14, append=True)       # 14-day RSI
data.ta.bbands(length=20, append=True)    # Bollinger Bands (20,2)
data.ta.atr(length=14, append=True)       # Average True Range (14-day)

# Save processed data
data.to_csv(f"data/processed_data/{ticker}_processed.csv")
```

### Visualize Price Charts and Indicators
  
  -> Plot candlestick charts with overlays.
  -> Detect Price Patterns
  -> Validate trends using volume.

## Quantitative Analysis

--\> Use math, statistics, and machine learning to model stock behavior.

### 1 Stationary Testing 
    - If not Make Data Stationary by transform data

### 2 Autocorrelation Analysis
    - Plot ACF and PACF

### 3 LSTM
    - Preprocess Data (stationary + sequences)
    - Build LSTM Model
    - Validate Models
    
### 4 Integrate Factor Models (CAPM)
    - Fetch Market Data
    - Calculate CAPM Metrics

### 5  Portfolio Optimization: Use Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
    - Estimate Risk Parameters (Covariance Matrix, Risk-Free Rate)
    - Set Up the Optimization Problem
          - Minimize portfolio variance for a given expected return, or
          - Maximize the Sharpe ratio (excess return per unit of risk).
      Constraints:
          - All weights sum to 1 (fully invested portfolio).
          - No short-selling if desired (weights >= 0).
          - Additional business constraints (e.g., max allocation per asset or sector).
    - Efficient Frontier Calculation
          - Optimization Techniques:
                - Use quadratic programming solvers (such as those in cvxopt, scipy.optimize, or libraries like PyPortfolioOpt) to compute the efficient frontier.
          - Visualize Results:
                - Plot the efficient frontier to display the trade-off between risk (volatility) and return.
                - Highlight the optimal portfolio (e.g., maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio) on the chart.




## Risk Management Integration

  - Position Sizing: Risk only 1-2% of your portfolio per trade.
  - Stop-Loss Strategy : Set stop-loss orders based on volatility (e.g., 2x ATR).
  - Diversification: Avoid overexposure to a single sector or asset.
  - Continuous Monitoring & Rebalancing
